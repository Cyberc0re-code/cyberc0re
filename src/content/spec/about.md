# About
Hey [Anshuman Sahoo a.k.a Cyberc0re](https://github.com/Cyberc0re-code) here 👋🏻.

I’m someone who loves figuring out how things work and sometimes, how they break. I spend my time in the world of cybersecurity, doing things like red teaming, pentesting, and playing CTFs where thinking outside the box is pretty much the whole game. 😉
<br/>
Enjoy the thrill of chasing down vulnerabilities, building labs🧪 and tools to learn something new, and diving into problems that don’t have obvious answers. It’s not just about hacking things it’s about curiosity, creativity, and constantly learning.
<br/>
When I’m not in front of a terminal, I’m probably talking security with friends, scribbling ideas on a whiteboard, or just recharging with some good music and coffee.🍵

Join me as I share my experiences, insights, and tips on cybersecurity. 
<br/>Let's explore the exciting journey of technology together!
